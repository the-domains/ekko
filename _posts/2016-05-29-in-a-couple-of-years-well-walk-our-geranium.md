"...plants should become part of our society as well as self-reliant, and be given the ability to autonomously interact and walk with us."__

"While plants lack a nervous system, they can, much like animals, become electro-chemically stimulated by their surrounding environment. Through the study of plant electro-physiology, we have wired their primitive 'intelligence' into the control-loop of an autonomous robotic ecosystem." William Victor Camilleri and Danilo Sampaio
